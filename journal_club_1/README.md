# ML101: Some Python Data Science Resources and scikit-learn examples

The two notebooks contain examples on recognizing handwritten digits using a variety of classifiers. They use a small dataset of 8x8 images from `scikit-learn` (`ML101.ipynb`) and a subset of MNIST - larger 28x28 images (`ML101-MNIST.ipynb`).
You can examine the notebooks just by clicking on them.

If you want to run and/or modify them download them to your local computer.
Then the notebooks can be run by executing

```
jupyter notebook
```

in the same directory as the notebook files. Then a browser window should open - then click on the appropriate notebook. Use SHIFT-ENTER to execute a cell...

You can also just download the pdf files to see the evaluated notebooks..

**Note:** The MNIST data files are not included as they are quite large >100Mb
